                I have many interests. Some people (my wife) may even say that I have too many interests. That may be true. I enjoy and get satisfaction out of many things. I will list a few just for kicks...

            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I have many career goals, though I would say some I would concider to be the most important. I would like to be able to support my family by one day making 6 figures. I would like to not hate my job. I do not have to love it, but I would like to not dread going into work every day. My last career goal would be to do something that makes a difference in the world. I do not want to do something that does not matter and does not effect peoples lives. I know these goals are very general and not specific. That is because I have not figured out the specifics yet.
            </p>

                Do you have any advice to help me reach my goals?

                I appreciate the feedback :)
